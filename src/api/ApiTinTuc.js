        text: `In the book Atomic Habits, James Clear describes a four-step process by which habits are made. These steps are cue, craving, response, and reward.\n\nThe cue tells your brain to begin a behavior. The craving is what makes you want to do something. The response is the actual habit that you perform. The response, in turn, gives you a reward. “Rewards are the end goal of every habit,” Clear writes.\n\nConsider this example. Maybe you have the habit of often checking social media. The cue might be a feeling of boredom while you are near your computer or phone. The craving could be a desire to stop that feeling. The response is checking social media, and the reward is seeing something interesting. When that process is repeated many times, it becomes a habit.\n\nClear believes that to create a good habit, you need to follow several steps. You need to make your new habit obvious, or easy to see or understand. The habit should also be attractive, simple and satisfying. Let’s think about how you might develop an English study habit.`,

For example, if you want to get in the habit of studying English every day, leave English books or notes in a very clear place.\n\nTo make your habit attractive, Clear recommends joining a culture where your new desired behavior is the normal behavior. For example, you could join a group of other English learners in online meetings.\n\nTo make your new habit easy, you could decrease the number of steps you have to take in order to study. You could also try reducing the amount of time you study. Clear suggests beginning your habits with limited, shorter time periods – two minutes for example. As you repeat the practice over time, you can go longer.\n\nAn important point to keep in mind is that if you place too many demands on yourself, you are more likely to give up on your new habit.\n\nFinally, you need to make your habit satisfying. You can give yourself a reward after completing your new habit. For example, if you study English for 15 minutes, you could reward yourself by listening to a song you like. Or you could think about how much progress you have made since you first started studying English.\n\nWood notes that your reward should come right after you do your new habit. “Rewards have to be experienced right after we do something in order to build habit associations ... in memory,” she writes.`,

        text: `Here are some tips to help students manage a large class\n\nEstablish rules\n\nResearchers suggest creating a list of classroom rules – with feedback from the students themselves. If students are part of such a process, they are more likely to follow rules for class.\n\nDarpak Sabankili is a high school English language teacher in Togo. He told VOA that he makes agreements with his students about the rules and what should happen when students break the rules. He then puts the list of rules on a wall in the classroom for everyone to see.\n\nOrganization and routine\n\nOrganization is extremely important with large groups of students, and keeping them focused.\n\ntart each class with an agenda for the day. When students know the plan for each class, they may be less likely to misbehave.\n\nIt also helps to have a method for getting students’ attention if the class starts to get noisy. This may include a “quiet signal” (such as raising your hand) or a word or phrase that you say with your class.\n\nPlan a variety of activities\n\nStudents may lose interest if class activities last for too long. This is especially true with large classes. Therefore, teachers should plan to have many different activities, with different levels of difficulty. This helps keep the class moving at a quick speed and helps prevent students from feeling bored.\n\nIncreasing student participation with pair and group work\n\nIn large classes, there is simply not enough time for a teacher to work with each and every student. In order to give students enough of a chance to practice English in class, teachers should consider organizing the class in pairs or groups.\n\nPair and group work can help make a large class feel smaller for students. Such work also gives them more opportunities to participate in class.\n\nForm groups and assign roles\n\nWhen forming groups for group work, it helps to give each student a role. These roles may include note-taker, timekeeper, leader, or presenter. Roles help students stay focused. They also give the students a sense of responsibility.\n\nTeachers can give one assignment or project for the group to turn in -- for a group grade.\n\nOne useful group activity is called a “jigsaw.” This is where each member of a group works on a certain part of an assignment. After finishing the task, each student shares his or her work with the group.\n\nFor example, each member in a group reads a different part of an English story or article. After finishing their part, each student explains or summarizes for the group the section that he or she read.`,

        text: `With large classes, teachers must spend a lot of time correcting all the students’ assignments. One effective tool is to have students exchange papers and correct each other’s work while the teacher calls out the answers. Teachers can also have students discuss answers with each other before answering questions, or work on assignments in pairs.\n\nDarpak says that he does a “Think-Pair-Share” activity with his classes. First, the teacher asks the class a question or gives out an assignment. The students first have time to think about the question themselves. Then, the students discuss their own ideas with a partner. Finally, the students share their answers with the class or with the teacher.\n\nTraining students for pair and group work\n\nIn many classrooms around the world, teachers often do most of the talking during class, while the students listen and take notes. Students may not be familiar with pair or group work. They may feel uncomfortable or not understand the purpose of such work.\n\nIf this is the case, students must be slowly trained to do interactive activities.\n\nTeachers can begin by having students work in pairs for very simple class activities. As they become more comfortable with the work, teachers can slowly increase the difficulty of the activities that students work on together.\n\nTeachers should take the time to discuss with their class the importance of pair and group work in large classes. Kwan Warapatsu, an English teacher in Thailand, says she spends time before activities discussing with her students why it is good for them to work together in class, and how it can help them improve their English.\n\nIf students better understand the importance of working together, they will be more willing to do it and likely have fewer behavioral problems during class.\n\nManaging large language classes is not easy. But with a little extra preparation, teachers and students can have a successful, meaningful experience.`,

The organization oversees a number of activities that involve climbing.\n\n“How many calories will I burn is the question everyone wants to know,” van Houten said. “Here’s the good news: The overall energy expenditure of the exercise depends on your weight.

Using them increases “the muscle mass involved..." by getting the arms involved, the study shows.\n\n“They are relatively small muscles in the arms, but better than nothing,” Minetti said.\n\nIf stair-climbing were an Olympic sport, Australian Suzy Walsham would own gold medals.\n\nShe has won 10 races up New York City’s Empire State Building — officially 1,576 stairs — and five climbs up the Eiffel Tower. Overall, Walsham has won more than 100 international stair races, and was once considered the top woman in the sport.\n\nWhen she was living in Singapore, Walsham climbed up her 29-story building — 37 times straight.

People depend on it to guide them through a complex world.\n\nThe invention of movable type in 15th century Europe revolutionized the communication of ideas. This invention made it possible to print and publish information to masses of people\n\nThis free flow of information eventually led to a free press in many parts of the world. But because information is so powerful, many world leaders have tried to stop it.\n\nFrench leader Napoleon Bonaparte once said he feared four newspapers more than 1,000 bayonets.\n\nThe Chinese emperor who oversaw the building of the Great Wall famously used his power to stop published information. Qin Shi Huang ordered the burning of thousands of books on subjects he wanted to keep from the people. He even had hundreds of scholars executed for refusing to give up their book collections`,

Information has fueled successful revolutions in many nations.

Smartphones and social media have become quick and easy tools to receive and share news and information. These tools have even made it possible for anyone with a device to gather and publish “news.”\n\nThis media environment makes it important for us to be able to recognize reliable information. True information gives us the facts to guide our decisions and actions.\n\nIn addition to informing, news can also divert.`,

        text: `And now, Words and Their Stories, from VOA Learning English.\n\nSwimming is a great exercise for staying healthy. But it can also be a life saving skill and help to keep you from drowning.\n\nHowever, in some bodies of water, swimming might be difficult. For example, in very deep, choppy or fast moving water swimming can be hard and even dangerous.\n\nChoppy water has many small, fast, close waves usually created by wind.\n\nWater currents and tides can be very strong. It is easier to swim with them and not so easy to swim against them.\n\nOn today’s show, we talk about several English expressions that use “swim” to describe different ways to face a situation -- especially danger, difficulty, or any hardship.\n\nLet’s start with swimming in rivers. Let’s say you jump in a river and swim downstream. That means you are swimming with the current of the water. This makes swimming easier and faster.`,

        text: `So, the expression to swim downstream means using the easy way to get something done.\n\nHowever, when you swim upstream, you have to fight the flow of the water. In some rivers or other bodies of water, swimming upstream is nearly impossible.\n\nAs an expression, swimming upstream means you take a more difficult path to do something. You make it harder for yourself.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\nDealing with money is not my strong suit. In fact, last year I was drowning in debt. Every month when bills arrived, I felt like I was swimming upstream. So I went to a financial advisor. Now I’m free of debt and staying on a budget.\n\nNow, if you are swimming in the ocean, sea, or other large body of water, you may be fighting the tide. Swimming against the tide is another expression. It means you are fighting against very powerful forces. And odds are you will not come out the winner.\n\nSwimming with the tide or current, is much easier. Again, this means you have taken an easier path. You have chosen an easier way to do something.`,

        text: `All of these expressions can be used another way. They can also mean that you are going with or against popular opinions or viewpoints.\n\nIf you are swimming with the tide or current or swimming downstream, you act the same way as the majority of others. You are going with the flow. That is another common expression – to go with the flow. People who go with the flow are easy-going. They take the popular path without protest.\n\nHowever, swimming upstream and swimming against the tide or current mean the opposite. You are rejecting a popular idea, behavior, or opinion. You are acting against the way the majority of people are acting.\n\nSwimming against the tide is harder. In a sense, you are an outsider or outcast. You do not have the support of the current or of other people.\n\nHere is an example. If all of your friends are getting married and moving to quiet areas, you may feel the urge to swim with the tide and do the same. Or you could swim against the tide and stay in your small apartment in the center of a busy city with lots of bars and restaurants nearby.\n\nAnd that’s all the time we have for this Words and Their Stories. Until next time … I’m Anna Matteo.`,
