        text: `On his deathbed, a father advised his son to always speak truth. The son promised that he would never tell a lie.\n\nOne day, while going to the city through a forest, he got surrounded by some robbers. One of them asked, "What do you have?\n\nThe boy answered, "I have fifty rupees."\n\nThey searched him but couldn't find anything. When they were about to go, the boy called out, "I am not telling a lie. See this fifty rupee note which I had hidden in my shirt."\n\nThe leader of the robbers felt pleased at the truthfulness of the boy, gave him hundred rupees as reward and went away.`,

Just nearby, grew some reeds with thin but flexible stems. They stood almost half in water and had flourished well too.\n\nOne day, strong winds blew. The tree, though huge and strong, broke from the middle and was thrown across the stream just among the reeds. On the other hand, the tree was very surprised to see that the reeds suffered no harm at all.\n\nThe oak could not make out the reason of the safety of the reeds and asked them, "How is it that, you being frail and slender, managed to face the gale without any harm. But I, strong enough, have been broken."\n\nThe reeds replied, "You were proud of your strength and refused to bend. So, you broke while we bowed and yielded to the gale and were spared."`,

At mid-day, they decided to take rest for some time but couldn't find any shady place around. So, the traveler decided to rest in the shade of the donkey. But the owner didn't let him do so as he himself wanted to sit in its shadow\n\nThe trveller said, "How can you refuse me the shadow? I have paid you money after all."\n\n"But you have paid for the ride, not for resting in his shadow", retorted the owner.\n\nSo, an argument followed between the two. When the donkey saw that the owner and the hirer were busy fighting, he took to his heels and was soon out of sight.`,

She was very happy to see his stout body and branched strong horns and thought, "stags have powerful horns, why should they be afraid of hounds, wolves then? It's sheer cowardice. I would never like my son to do it at all."\n\nAfter some time, the hind's son came there. The hind wanted to teach him to be courageous. She said, "Son! You have a stout body and strong horns. So, you must not run away from hounds and wolves. Don't be a coward."\n\n"Ok, mom; I won't", said the stag.\n\nJust then the mother and the son heard the bark of the hounds. The hind got ready to run away when her son asked her to stay on. She said, "You may, but I have no horns."\n\nSaying so, she ran as fast as she could.\n\nThe mother herself was a coward and was teaching courage to her son. What a satire!`,

The well-dressed gentleman responds, "You are not going to spend in on liquor are you?"\n\n"No, sir, I don't drink," retorts the bum.\n\n"You are not going to throw it away in some crap game, are you?" asks the gentleman.\n\n"No way, I don't gamble," answers the bum.\n\n"You wouldn't waste the money at a golf course for greens fees, would you?" asks the man.\n\n"Never," says the bum, "I don't play golf."\n\nThe man asks the bum if he would like to come home with him for a home cooked meal. The bum accepts eagerly. While they are heading for the man's house, the bum's curiosity gets the better of him. "Isn't your wife going to be angry when she sees a guy like me at your table?"\n\n"Probably," says the man, "but it will be worth it. I want her to see what happens to a guy who doesn't drink, gamble or play golf."`,

        text: `Don't stop giving love even if you don't receive it. Smile and patience.

You may only be one person to the world but you may be the world to one person

I may not be pretty, I'm not rich. I don't have a perfect body, but I have a good and warm heart for those who care.

A great lover is not one who lover many, but one who loves one woman for life

The love only beautiful when the unfinished

Loves is not getting, but giving.

Love means you never have to say you're sorry

Love is facing the same direction

Never frown, even when you are sad, who is falling in love with your smile`,

The tears fall, they're so easy to wipe off onto my sleeve, but how do I erase the stain from my heart?

Whoever said it is better to have loved and lost, then to have never loved at all must have never had their heart broken.

Happiness is but a mere episode in the general drama of pain.`,

Don't get let your dreams just be dreams

We can't change yesterday, but we can change today

If I fail, I try again, and again, and again...

Take care of your body. Its the only place you have to live

Friendship may, and often does, grow into love, but love never subsides into friendshop

You can't change the past, but you can ruin the present by worrying about the future

In life you have a choice: Bitter or Better? Choose better, forget bitter

Don't wait for the perfect moment and make it perfect.

You'll never be brave if you don't get hurt. You'll never learn If you don't make mistakes. You'll never be successful If you don't encounter failure.`,
